## ABOUT
The summer after my 3rd year of uni I decided to fix the three main problems with myself: I was a washed radiant, I was fat, and I had no good projects on my portfolio. I created this app to keep myself accountable, be something I would actually use daily to help stay organized, and teach myself SwiftUI.


# Build Training Arc
xcodebuild -project HaruNotes.xcodeproj -scheme HaruNotes build

# Run Training Arc on simulator
First boot a simulator, then use:
xcodebuild -project HaruNotes.xcodeproj -scheme HaruNotes -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' run

## OR just hit the play button on Xcode (probably works)
